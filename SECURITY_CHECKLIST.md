- [x] Prompt validation with length limits and content filtering
- [x] API key format validation
- [x] SQL injection pattern detection
- [x] Command injection prevention

### 3. Security Headers
- [x] Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
- [x] X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- [x] X-Frame-Options: DENY
- [x] X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- [x] Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) in production
- [x] Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- [x] Permissions-Policy for camera/microphone restrictions

### 4. CSRF Protection
- [x] CSRF token middleware

- [x] Session-based token verification
- [x] Token expiration handling

### 5. Error Handling
- [x] Sanitized error messages in production
- [x] Sensitive information filtering
- [x] Proper HTTP status codes
- [x] No information disclosure in error responses

### 6. API Security
- [x] Enhanced input validation for generation endpoint
- [x] Provider validation and sanitization  
- [x] Rate limiting preparation (infrastructure in place)
- [x] Proper authentication checks

### 7. Environment Security
- [x] Updated environment variable requirements
- [x] Strong encryption key validation
- [x] Secure defaults removal
- [x] Production vs development security controls

## üîÑ In Progress

### Rate Limiting
- [x] Rate limiting infrastructure implemented
- [ ] Redis integration for distributed rate limiting
- [ ] User quota system activation
- [ ] IP blacklist/whitelist implementation

### Monitoring & Logging
- [x] Security audit logging framework
- [ ] Intrusion detection alerts
- [ ] Failed login attempt monitoring
- [ ] API abuse detection

## üìã Next Steps (Recommended)

### 1. Immediate Actions
- [ ] Set up strong environment variables in production
- [ ] Enable Redis for rate limiting
- [ ] Configure monitoring alerts
- [ ] Set up automated security scanning

### 2. Advanced Security
- [ ] Implement API versioning
- [ ] Add request signing for sensitive operations
- [ ] Set up Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- [ ] Implement content filtering for generated images

### 3. Compliance & Auditing
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] GDPR compliance review
- [ ] Security incident response plan

### 4. User Security
- [ ] Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- [ ] Account lockout policies  
- [ ] Password strength requirements
- [ ] Session management improvements

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices Applied

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal necessary permissions
3. **Fail Secure**: Secure defaults when errors occur
4. **Input Validation**: All inputs validated and sanitized
5. **Output Encoding**: Proper encoding to prevent XSS
6. **Secure Configuration**: No default passwords or weak settings
7. **Error Handling**: No sensitive information in error messages
8. **Logging**: Security events properly logged

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations for Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all secrets are properly set
2. **HTTPS Only**: Force HTTPS in production
3. **Database Security**: Use connection encryption and authentication
4. **Container Security**: If using containers, ensure secure base images
5. **Network Security**: Implement proper network segmentation
6. **Backup Security**: Encrypt backups and control access
